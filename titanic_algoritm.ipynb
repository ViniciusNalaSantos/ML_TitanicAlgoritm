Kaggle allows users to publish datasets, use GPU-integrated notebooks, and compete with other data scientists to solve data science challenges. Initially, this online platform aims to help professionals and learners reach their goals in their data science journey with the powerful tools and resources it provides. Today (2023), there are over 10 million registered users on Kaggle.\n  \n  All users can dispute with each other to see who builds the more precise machine learning model in the competition. In this article, we will construct one for \"Titanic - Machine Learning From Disaster\" competition. The objective is very simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. I chose this contest because it is well-known as the \"Hello World!\" of data science area, so there wasn't a better option to do an article showing the machine learning basics.\n\n### Table of Contents\n  \n[Part One](#part_one)\n* [Introduction](#introduction)\n* [Understand the Problem](#understand_problem)\n* [Obtain Data](#obtain_data)\n* [Exploratory Data Analysis](#exploratory_data_analysis)\n    - [Data Dictionary](#data_dictionary)\n    - [Overview](#overview)\n    - [Percentage of Missing Values](#percentage_missing_values)\n    - [Statistic Distribution](#statistic_distribution)\n    - [Which groups of people have more chance to survive?](#question)\n* [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\n[Part Two](#part_two)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"part_one\"></a>\n<h2><b> Part One </b></h2>\n\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"introduction\"></a>\n## Introduction\n   Every project in data science area requires - before importing the dataset and starting coding - follow a few steps:\n   \n- Understand the problem\n- Obtain data\n- Explore the data\n- Prepare the dataset\n- Modeling\n- Evaluate\n\nWhen you plan the route that you will take, doing a flowchart or a checklist of the sequence of tasks that needs to be done, the way becomes easier to surpass.\n  \n#### Code from the article: [Machine Learning](https://nodejs.org/)\n   \n----","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"understand_problem\"></a>\n## Understand the problem\n  Although the variable luck played an important role in the survival of some passengers, there were people more prone to survive than others.
